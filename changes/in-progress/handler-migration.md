# Handler Migration Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating handlers from the core `theater` crate to separate `theater-handler-*` crates.

See the full proposal: [2025-11-30-handler-migration.md](../proposals/2025-11-30-handler-migration.md)

## Migration Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Simple Handlers

| timing | ✅ COMPLETE | `theater-handler-timing` | `src/host/timing.rs` | Fully migrated |
| environment | ✅ COMPLETE | `theater-handler-environment` | `src/host/environment.rs` | Migrated 2025-11-30 |
| runtime | ✅ COMPLETE | `theater-handler-runtime` | `src/host/runtime.rs` | Migrated 2025-11-30 |

### ❌ Phase 2: Medium Complexity

| supervisor | ❌ NOT STARTED | `theater-handler-supervisor` | `src/host/supervisor.rs` | Complex orchestration |

### ❌ Phase 4: Framework Handlers

## Overall Progress

- **Completed**: 8/11 (73%)
- **In Progress**: 0/11 (0%)
- **Not Started**: 3/11 (27%)

## Current Sprint

### Active Work
- No active work at the moment

### Blocked
None currently

### Next Up
1. Begin Phase 3 complex handlers (process, store, supervisor)
2. Update core theater crate to use new handlers
3. Phase 4 framework handlers

## Cleanup Checklist

For each completed handler migration:
- [ ] New handler crate fully implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Old implementation removed from `/crates/theater/src/host/`
