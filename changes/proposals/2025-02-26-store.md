# Description

I want to add a store to the theater system.
The store should be a persistent key-value store that uses content-addressed storage in the filesystem.
Data should be stored in theater/store/data/{hash} where {hash} is the sha1 hash of the data.
The store should also have a labelling system that allows for multiple labels to be associated with a single piece of data.
A label is a string, stored at theater/store/labels/{label} that contains a single hash or a list of hashes separated by newlines.
