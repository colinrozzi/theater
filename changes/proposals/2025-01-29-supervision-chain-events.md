# Supervision and Chain Event System

## Description

### Overview
Building out the supervisor system to enable proper actor management, focusing on chain events and lifecycle events from child to parent actors.

### Key Components
1. Parent-Child Relationship Management
   - Track parent/supervisor for each actor
   - Enable hierarchical actor management
   - Associate child actor lifecycle with parent

2. Chain Event Routing
   - Forward chain events to parent actors
   - Enable verification and monitoring of state changes
   - Allow supervisors to track child state

3. Lifecycle Event System
   - Send actor lifecycle events to parents
   - Enable supervisors to monitor child health
   - Support restart/recovery strategies

### Motivation
Currently, actors operate independently without proper supervision. This makes it difficult to:
- Manage actor lifecycles
- Handle failures gracefully
- Monitor actor state changes
- Implement recovery strategies

### Dependencies
- Requires the new random ID system (2025-01-29-random-id-system.md)
- Will build on existing chain event infrastructure

### Expected Benefits
- Robust actor supervision
- Better failure handling
- Clearer actor hierarchies
- More manageable state tracking
- Foundation for complex actor systems

### Potential Risks
- Additional message passing overhead
- Complexity in handling supervisor failures
- Need to carefully manage supervisor state

## Working Notes

### 2025-01-29
Initial planning phase:
- Dependencies on random ID system implementation
- Need to extend message system for parent/child communication
- Planning chain event forwarding mechanism

### Next Steps
1. Extend actor configuration to include parent ID
2. Implement chain event forwarding
3. Create lifecycle event system
4. Build supervisor monitoring capabilities
5. Add recovery strategies
