[x] need to change the state-management file to a chain file
[x] need to make the architecture file not just a list of bullet points
[x] handlers - need to make the first handlers file a general explanation
[ ] make a getting-started file
[ ] README? what are we doing here? Does not really describe the project?
[x] should document all of the handlers and their configuration
[ ] then its all about updating, really not sure about the correctness of anything. on the list is:
  [ ] building-actors
  [ ] building-host-functions
  [ ] making-changes
  [ ] cli
  [ ] configuration
  [ ] api
[x] store docs are out of date, this is just dealing with the one runtime store
[ ] not really a fan of StateChain as a struct, it should just be Chain
[ ] idk
