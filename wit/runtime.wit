/// # Runtime Interface
///
/// The `runtime` interface provides core runtime capabilities to actors in the Theater system.
/// It allows actors to access their environment, log messages, and retrieve their event chain.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This interface serves as a bridge between the actor and its execution environment,
/// providing essential services for operation, debugging, and state management. It enables
/// actors to log information to the system and access their immutable event history.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```wit
/// // Using the runtime interface in a WIT definition
/// use ntwk:theater/runtime;
///
/// // Using the runtime interface in a Rust implementation
/// runtime::log("Actor initialized successfully");
/// let my_chain = runtime::get_chain();
/// ```
///
/// ## Security
///
/// The runtime interface is designed to be safe to expose to all actors, as it provides
/// only read access to state and controlled logging functionality. It doesn't allow actors
/// to modify runtime state or access system resources outside their sandbox.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// This interface is typically implemented by the Theater runtime and automatically
/// provided to all actors. No special configuration is required to use it, though
/// logging behavior can be controlled through manifest settings.

interface runtime {
    use types.{json, chain, actor-id};

    /// Logs a message to the actor's log stream.
    ///
    /// ## Purpose
    ///
    /// This function allows actors to send log messages to the Theater logging system.
    /// Messages are tagged with the actor's ID and can be viewed through the Theater CLI
    /// or event subscription system.
    ///
    /// ## Parameters
    ///
    /// * `msg` - The message to log
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// // In Rust actor code
    /// runtime::log("Processing request with ID: 12345");
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Implementation Notes
    ///
    /// Log messages are subject to the logging level configuration specified in the actor's
    /// manifest. The Theater runtime may filter or redirect logs based on this configuration.
    log: func(msg: string);

    /// Retrieves the actor's event chain.
    ///
    /// ## Purpose
    ///
    /// This function provides access to the actor's complete event history as a chain of
    /// cryptographically linked events. This allows actors to inspect their state evolution
    /// and verify the integrity of their history.
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// * `chain` - The actor's event chain containing all recorded events
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// // In Rust actor code
    /// let chain = runtime::get_chain();
    /// 
    /// // Count events by type
    /// let mut event_counts = std::collections::HashMap::new();
    /// for event in chain.events {
    ///     *event_counts.entry(event.event_type.clone()).or_insert(0) += 1;
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Security
    ///
    /// The event chain is immutable and cryptographically verifiable, ensuring that actors
    /// cannot tamper with their event history. This provides a secure audit trail of all
    /// actor actions.
    get-chain: func() -> chain;
