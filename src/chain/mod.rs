//! # Event Chain System
//!
//! The `chain` module provides Theater's core event tracking and verification system,
//! implementing an append-only log that records all actions and state changes within an actor.
//! This creates a verifiable history of an actor's execution that can be used for debugging,
//! auditing, and recovery.
//!
//! ## Core Features
//!
//! * **Immutable Event Logging**: All actor actions are recorded as immutable events in a chain
//! * **Cryptographic Verification**: Events are linked with cryptographic hashes for integrity
//! * **State Reconstruction**: An actor's state can be reconstructed by replaying its chain
//! * **Event Serialization**: Events can be stored, transmitted, and restored
//! * **Content-Addressed Storage**: Events are identified by their content hash
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The module is built around these key components:
//!
//! * `ChainEvent`: A single immutable event in the chain with cryptographic hash linking
//! * `StateChain`: Collection of events representing the complete execution history of an actor
//! * `ChainEventData`: Typed event data with specific payload structures for different event types
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! The event chain system uses cryptographic hashes to ensure the integrity of the event history,
//! making it possible to detect any tampering or corruption. Each event links to its parent, creating
//! a tamper-evident chain of custody for all actor state changes.

/// # Chain Event
///
/// `ChainEvent` represents a single immutable event in an actor's execution history.
/// Each event is cryptographically linked to its parent through hash references,
/// forming a tamper-evident chain of events that can be verified for integrity.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This struct is the core building block of the audit system in Theater. It captures
/// a specific action or state change, stores the relevant data, and maintains the
/// cryptographic linking that ensures the integrity of the event history. Events are
/// content-addressed, meaning they are identified by a hash of their content.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use theater::chain::ChainEvent;
/// use theater::events::ChainEventData;
/// 
/// // Create an event
/// let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4]; // Example binary data
/// let event = ChainEvent {
///     hash: vec![],           // Will be filled by the system
///     parent_hash: None,      // This is a root event with no parent
///     event_type: "example".to_string(),
///     data,
///     timestamp: chrono::Utc::now().timestamp() as u64,
///     description: Some("Example event".to_string()),
/// };
/// ```
///
/// ## Security
///
/// The hash of each event is calculated based on its content, and each event references
/// its parent's hash. This creates a chain of cryptographic links that makes it impossible
/// to modify any event without breaking the chain, allowing for verification of the
/// entire history.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// Events are serialized to JSON for storage and transmission. The `Display` implementation
/// provides a human-readable representation of the event, making events easier to read in logs
/// and debugging output.

///

/// the event history.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This struct serves as the main interface for an actor's event history. It enforces
/// the append-only nature of the event log, handles the cryptographic linking between
/// events, and provides an API for working with the event history. Each actor in the
/// Theater system has its own associated StateChain.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use theater::chain::StateChain;
/// use theater::events::{ChainEventData, EventData};
/// use theater::id::TheaterId;
/// use tokio::sync::mpsc;

/// The state chain enforces the append-only property and maintains the cryptographic
/// linking between events, ensuring that the entire history can be verified for
/// integrity. The verification process checks that each event properly links to its
/// parent and that the content hashes match.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// When a new event is added to the chain, it's also sent to the Theater runtime

    /// ## Purpose
    ///
    /// This method provides access to the most recent event in the chain, which
    /// represents the current state of the actor's execution history. It's useful
    /// for quickly accessing the latest event without having to traverse the entire
    /// chain.
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// * `Some(&ChainEvent)` - Reference to the most recent event, if the chain is not empty
    /// * `None` - If the chain is empty and there are no events
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use theater::chain::StateChain;
    /// # use theater::id::TheaterId;
    /// # use tokio::sync::mpsc;
    /// #
    /// # fn example() {
    /// # let (theater_tx, _) = mpsc::channel(100);
    /// # let actor_id = TheaterId::generate();
    /// # let chain = StateChain::new(actor_id, theater_tx);
    /// #
    /// // Get the most recent event
    /// if let Some(last_event) = chain.get_last_event() {
    ///     println!("Last event type: {}", last_event.event_type);
    /// } else {
    ///     println!("No events in the chain yet");
    /// }
    /// # }
    /// ```
    pub fn get_last_event(&self) -> Option<&ChainEvent> {
        self.events.last()
    }

    /// Gets all events in the chain as an ordered slice.
    ///
    /// ## Purpose
    ///
    /// This method provides access to the complete event history in chronological
    /// order, allowing for traversal, analysis, or filtering of events. This is
    /// useful for debugging, auditing, or reconstructing actor state.
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// * `&[ChainEvent]` - A slice of all events in the chain, from oldest to newest
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use theater::chain::StateChain;
    /// # use theater::id::TheaterId;
    /// # use tokio::sync::mpsc;
    /// #
    /// # fn example() {
    /// # let (theater_tx, _) = mpsc::channel(100);
    /// # let actor_id = TheaterId::generate();
    /// # let chain = StateChain::new(actor_id, theater_tx);
    /// #
    /// // Get all events and count them by type
    /// let events = chain.get_events();
    /// println!("Total events: {}", events.len());
    ///
    /// // Count events by type
    /// let mut type_counts = std::collections::HashMap::new();
    /// for event in events {
    ///     *type_counts.entry(event.event_type.clone()).or_insert(0) += 1;
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Print counts
    /// for (event_type, count) in type_counts {
    ///     println!("{}: {}", event_type, count);
    /// }
