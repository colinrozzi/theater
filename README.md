# Theater

A WebAssembly actor system that enables state management, verification, and flexible interaction patterns.

[Read more about why we built Theater and its core concepts â†’](docs/why-theater.md)

## Features

- **Actor State Management**: Actors maintain verifiable state with complete history
- **Hash Chain Verification**: All state changes are recorded in a verifiable hash chain
- **Multiple Interface Types**: Support for:
  - Actor-to-actor messaging
  - HTTP server capabilities
  - HTTP client capabilities
  - Extensible interface system

## Development Setup

### Using Nix (Recommended)

Theater uses Nix with flakes for reproducible development environments. Here's how to get started:

1. First, install Nix:
https://nixos.org/download/

2. Enable flakes by either:
   - Adding to your `/etc/nix/nix.conf`:
     ```
     experimental-features = nix-command flakes
     ```
   - Or using the environment variable for each command:
     ```bash
     export NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
     ```

3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colinrozzi/theater.git
   cd theater
   ```

4. Enter the development environment:
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

The development environment provides:
- Rust toolchain with the exact version needed
- LLVM and Clang for wasmtime
- All required system dependencies
- Development tools like `cargo-watch`, `cargo-expand`, etc.

#### Common Nix Commands

- Start a new shell with the development environment:
  ```bash
  nix develop
  ```

- Run a command in the development environment without entering a shell:
  ```bash
  nix develop --command cargo build
  ```

- Update flake dependencies:
  ```bash
  nix flake update
  ```

#### Troubleshooting Nix

- If you see "experimental feature" errors:
  Make sure you've enabled flakes as described above.

- If you see "nix-command" errors:
  Your Nix installation might be too old. Update it with:
  ```bash
  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nix
  ```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use Nix, you'll need:

1. Rust 1.81.0 or newer
2. LLVM and Clang for building wasmtime
3. CMake
4. OpenSSL and pkg-config

Then:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinrozzi/theater.git
cd theater
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build
```

## Running

To run an actor with a manifest:
```bash
cargo run -- --manifest path/to/your/manifest.toml
```

## Actor Manifests

Actors are configured using TOML manifests. Example:

```toml
name = "my-actor"
component_path = "path/to/actor.wasm"

[interface]
implements = "ntwk:simple-actor/actor"
requires = []

# Optional message-server capability
[[handlers]]
type = "message-server"
config = { port = 8080 }
interface = "ntwk:theater/message-server-client"

# Optional HTTP server capability
[[handlers]]
type = "http-server"
config = { port = 8081 }
```

Note: The message-server handler is optional and requires implementing the `message-server-client` interface if you want your actor to handle messages.

## Development Tools

When using the Nix development environment, you get access to several useful tools:

- `cargo clippy` - Run the Rust linter
- `cargo fmt` - Format your code
- `cargo test` - Run the test suite
- `cargo watch` - Watch for changes and automatically rebuild
- `cargo expand` - Show macro expansions
- `cargo udeps` - Find unused dependencies

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Run the tests (`cargo test`)
4. Run the linter (`cargo clippy`)
5. Format your code (`cargo fmt`)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open a Pull Request
