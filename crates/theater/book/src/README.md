# Theater Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Theater, a WebAssembly actor system designed for building secure, reliable, and transparent AI agent infrastructure.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is organized into sections:

- **Introduction**: Understand why Theater exists and the challenges it addresses in AI agent systems
- **Core Concepts**: Learn what Theater is and its fundamental principles
- **Use Cases**: Explore how Theater can be applied to build robust AI agent systems
- **User Guide**: Find practical information on using Theater in your projects
- **Development**: Learn how to build agents and extend Theater's functionality
- **Services**: Explore the built-in services and handler systems
- **API Reference**: Access detailed API documentation

## The Three Pillars of Theater

Theater is built on three foundational pillars that make it ideal for AI agent infrastructure:

1. **[WebAssembly Components & Sandboxing](core-concepts/wasm-components.md)**: Security boundaries and capability controls for agent containment
2. **[Actor Model & Supervision](core-concepts/actor-model.md)**: Isolated agents, message-passing communication, and fault tolerance through supervision
3. **[Traceability & Verification](core-concepts/traceability.md)**: Comprehensive tracking of all agent actions for transparency and debugging

Understanding these pillars provides the foundation for building effective AI agent systems with Theater.

## Theater for AI Agents

Theater provides the infrastructure needed to build trustworthy AI agent systems:

- **Secure Execution**: Run agents in sandboxed environments with precise capability controls
- **Agent Orchestration**: Create hierarchies of specialized agents that work together
- **Complete Traceability**: Capture and analyze every action taken by agents
- **Failure Resilience**: Automatically recover from agent failures through supervision
- **Transparent Operation**: Build trust through comprehensive visibility into agent behavior
