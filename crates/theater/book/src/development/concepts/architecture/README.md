# Theater Architecture

This section provides a detailed explanation of how Theater works internally. It covers the implementation details, component relationships, and design decisions that form the foundation of the system.

While the "Core Concepts" section focuses on what Theater is and its fundamental ideas, this section delves into how those concepts are implemented.

## Who Is This Section For?

- **Contributors** who want to understand the codebase to make modifications or extensions
- **Advanced users** seeking a deeper understanding of the internal workings
- **Those implementing similar systems** who want to learn from Theater's design

## What's Covered

This section explains:

- **Component Relationships**: How different parts of Theater interact
- **Internal Design Decisions**: Why specific technical approaches were chosen
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics of key subsystems
