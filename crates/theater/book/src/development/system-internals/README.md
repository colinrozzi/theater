# System Internals

This section provides a deep dive into the internal architecture and implementation details of Theater. It's designed for contributors and advanced users who want to understand how Theater works under the hood.

## Who Should Read This Section

- **Contributors** working on the Theater codebase
- **Advanced users** looking to extend or customize Theater
- **Curious learners** interested in system design principles

## What's Covered

This section explores the technical implementation of Theater's core concepts:

1. **System Architecture**: The overall design and component relationships
2. **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
3. **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics of key subsystems
4. **ID System**: How actors and resources are identified
5. **Interface System**: How components communicate
6. **State Management**: Implementation of the state storage mechanisms
7. **Store System**: Technical details of the content-addressable storage

While the Core Concepts section explains what Theater is and its fundamental principles, this section explains how those principles are implemented in practice.

## Navigating This Section

The content is organized from high-level architecture to specific implementation details. If you're new to Theater's internals, we recommend starting with the System Architecture page before diving into specific subsystems.
