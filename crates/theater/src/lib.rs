//! # Theater Actor System
//!
//! Theater is a runtime for managing and executing WebAssembly actors in a distributed system.
//! It provides a framework for creating, managing, and communicating with actors that are
//! implemented as WebAssembly components.
//!
//! ## Core Features
//!
//! * **Actor Management**: Create, start, stop, and monitor actors
//! * **State Management**: Persistent actor state with event chain tracking
//! * **Message Passing**: Communication between actors and external systems
//! * **WebAssembly Integration**: Run actors as sandboxed WebAssembly components
//! * **Extensible Handlers**: Support for HTTP, WebSockets, and custom protocols
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Theater is built around these key components:
//!
//! * `TheaterRuntime`: The central runtime that manages the lifecycle of actors
//! * `ActorRuntime`: Manages the execution environment for a single actor
//! * `ActorHandle`: Provides an interface for interacting with actors
//! * `StateChain`: Tracks the history of state changes for an actor
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//!
//! ## Security and Safety
//!
//! Theater runs actors in isolated WebAssembly environments with configurable resource limits
//! and capabilities. This provides strong security boundaries between actors and between
//! actors and the host system.
