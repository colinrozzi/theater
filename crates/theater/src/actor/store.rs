//! # Actor Store
//!
//! This module provides an abstraction for sharing resources between an actor and the Theater runtime system.
//! The ActorStore serves as a container for state, event chains, and communication channels that are
//! needed for WASM host functions to interface with the Actor system.

/// - Communication channels to the Theater runtime
/// - The event chain for audit and verification
/// - The actor's current state data
/// - A handle to interact with the actor
