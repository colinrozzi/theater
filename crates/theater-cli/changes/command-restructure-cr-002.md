# Theater CLI Command Structure Restructure - Change Request

**Status**: Planning Phase - Ready for Implementation  
**Created**: 2025-07-20  
**Updated**: 2025-07-20  
**Target**: Phase 3 - Command Organization and Enhanced Functionality  
**Related**: [modernization-cr-001.md](./modernization-cr-001.md)

## Executive Summary

This change request proposes a comprehensive restructuring of the Theater CLI command organization from a flat command structure to a hierarchical, grouped structure. The restructuring addresses scalability concerns, improves discoverability, and provides a foundation for advanced functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Problem Statement

The current CLI has grown to include numerous commands in a flat structure that creates several issues:

### Current State Analysis
- **18+ top-level commands** making help output overwhelming
- **Poor discoverability** of related functionality scattered across different command names
- **Limited scalability** as new features require new top-level commands
- **Inconsistent naming** and organization of related operations
- **No logical grouping** of actor, event, message, and server operations

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Actor Operations Scattered**: `create`, `build`, `start`, `stop`, `list`, `inspect`, `state`, `list-stored` all at top level
2. **Event Commands Mixed**: `events`, `events-explore`, `subscribe` don't clearly indicate they're related
3. **No Server Management**: No way to check server status, logs, or configuration
4. **Future Growth Blocked**: Adding new functionality requires polluting the top-level namespace

## Solution Overview

Implement a hierarchical command structure with logical groupings:

```bash
# Current (Flat Structure)
theater create <name>
theater build [path]
theater start <manifest>
theater stop <id>
theater list
theater events <id>
theater subscribe <id>
theater message <id> <msg>

# Proposed (Hierarchical Structure)
theater actor create <name>
theater actor build [path]
theater actor start <manifest>
theater actor stop <id>
theater actor send <id> <msg>
theater actor request <id> <msg>
theater actor channel <id>
theater actor subscribe <id>

theater event list
theater event <event-id>
theater event chain <event-id>

theater server status
```

## üèóÔ∏è Detailed Design

### New Command Hierarchy

#### Actor Commands (`theater actor`)
**Purpose**: Complete actor lifecycle management

```bash
theater actor create <name> [--template <template>]
theater actor build [path] [--release] [--clean]
theater actor start <manifest> [--subscribe] [--parent]
theater actor stop <id> [--timeout <sec>] [--force]
theater actor inspect <id>
theater actor state <id>
theater actor send <id> <message>
theater actor request <id> <message> [--timeout <sec>]
theater actor channel <id> [--create] [--list]
theater actor subscribe <id> [--format <format>]
```

#### Event Commands (`theater event`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive event system operations

```bash
theater event list <actor-id> [--limit <n>] [--format <format>]
theater event export <actor-id> [--output <file>] [--format <format>]
```

#### Server Commands (`theater server`) - NEW
**Purpose**: Server management and monitoring

```bash
theater server list [--all] [--format <format>]
theater server status [--watch <interval>]
theater server config [--key <key>]
theater server config show [--section <section>]
theater server config edit [--editor <editor>]
theater server metrics [--type <type>] [--window <time>]
theater server health [--check] [--monitor]
```

#### Completion Commands (`theater completion`)
**Purpose**: Shell completion management

```bash
theater completion generate <shell>
theater completion install <shell> [--force]
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Command Dispatch Changes

#### Current Implementation
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    Create(commands::create::CreateArgs),
    Build(commands::build::BuildArgs),
    Start(commands::start::StartArgs),
    // ... 15+ more top-level commands
}
```

#### New Implementation
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    /// Actor lifecycle management
    Actor(ActorCommands),
    /// Event system operations  
    Event(EventCommands),
    /// Server operations
    Server(ServerCommands),
    /// Completion management
    Completion(CompletionCommands)
}
```

### New Command Implementations

Priority new commands to implement:

1. **Server Status** (`theater server status`)
   - Connection status to server
   - Server uptime and version
   - Basic resource usage
   - Number of active actors

2. **Event Export** (`theater event export`)
   - Export events to JSON, CSV, or YAML
   - Time range filtering
   - Event type filtering
   - Large dataset handling

3. **Config Management** (`theater server config show/set/get`)
   - Display current configuration
   - Set configuration values
   - Reset to defaults
   - Edit in preferred editor

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Command Context
Remember context to reduce typing:
```bash
theater actor select my-actor-123
theater state        # operates on my-actor-123
theater restart      # operates on my-actor-123
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
theater interactive
theater> actor create my-new-actor
theater> actor start my-new-actor/manifest.toml
theater> event subscribe my-new-actor
```

## üéØ Conclusion

This command structure restructuring represents a significant improvement in the Theater CLI's usability, maintainability, and extensibility. By organizing commands into logical groups, we create a foundation that can grow naturally while maintaining the excellent user experience established in the previous modernization phase.

The hierarchical structure aligns with user mental models (actors, events, messages, server) and provides clear pathways for discovering and using functionality. This change will benefit both new and existing users.

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 3.1 implementation with the new CLI command structure definitions.
