# Core Concepts

Theater is built on three fundamental pillars that work together to create a system that is secure, reliable, and transparent. This section explains what Theater is and the key concepts that make it the ideal infrastructure for AI agent systems.

## The Three Pillars of Theater

### [WebAssembly Components & Sandboxing](./wasm-components.md)

WebAssembly provides the foundation for Theater's security and capability controls:

- Strong security boundaries through sandboxing
- Deterministic execution for reproducible behavior
- Language-agnostic agent implementation
- Capability-based security model for precise access control

### [Actor Model & Supervision](./actor-model.md)

The Actor Model enables Theater's approach to agent organization, communication, and fault tolerance:

- Agents as independent, isolated entities
- Message-passing for all agent-to-agent communication
- Private state management for each agent
- Hierarchical supervision for reliable agent systems

### [Traceability & Verification](./traceability.md)

Traceability ensures that all agent actions are observable, auditable, and debuggable:

- Event Chain capturing every agent action
- Deterministic replay for verification and debugging
- State management for consistent agent snapshots
- Comprehensive tools for inspection and analysis

## How The Pillars Work Together

These three pillars complement each other to create Theater's unique properties for agent systems:

- **WebAssembly + Actor Model**: Provides secure agents with clear communication patterns
- **WebAssembly + Traceability**: Enables deterministic replay and verification of agent behavior
- **Actor Model + Traceability**: Supports failure diagnosis and recovery in complex agent systems

By understanding these core concepts, you'll have a solid foundation for building reliable, secure, and transparent AI agent systems with Theater.
