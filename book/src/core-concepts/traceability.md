# Traceability & Verification

Traceability is Theater's approach to ensuring transparency, auditability, and reproducibility of system behavior. This pillar explains how Theater tracks all system activities to enable verification and debugging.


Now, we have isolated, deterministic actors that communicate through message-passing. We have very clear distinctions between what is inside and outside an actor. Inside an actor we have a sandboxed, deterministic environment. Our traceability system is built to essentially sit on the barrier between the outside world and the inside world, and track everything that passes through that barrier. This is the Event Chain.
The Event Chain captures all inputs and outputs of every function call into an actor. Because state is returned by the actor in each of its function calls, this means the Event Chain captures all state changes. Each event in the chain is hashed, and each new event includes the hash of the previous event in its contents. This creates a chain of events that is cryptographically verifiable. If any event at any point in the chain is modified, the resulting hash of the chain will change.
Because wasm execution is deterministic, sandboxed, and portable, any actor can be replayed anywhere else and will produce the same result. To start, this will be invaluable for debugging and iteration. If an actor runs into an error, the chain can be saved, a new version of the actor can be created, and the actor can be replayed with the same chain until the error is fixed. This will allow for rapid iteration and debugging of actors, as well as the ability to reproduce errors in a controlled environment. Hopefully, this will enable us to find and fix bugs faster than we can in a traditional system, and allow for some level of automated improvement of our systems.



## The Event Chain System

At the core of Theater's traceability is the Event Chain:

- **Comprehensive Record**: Captures all inputs, outputs, and state changes
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Events are cryptographically linked
- **Tamper-Evident**: Modifications to the chain are detectable
- **Complete System View**: The chain provides the entire system history

Every action in Theater is recorded in this chain, creating a verifiable record of what happened and when.

## What Gets Recorded

The Event Chain captures a wide range of events:

- **Actor Creation**: When actors are created and with what parameters
- **Message Delivery**: All messages sent between actors
- **External Inputs**: Data coming from outside the system
- **External Outputs**: Responses sent to external systems
- **State Changes**: When actors modify their stored state
- **Errors**: Any failures or exceptions that occur
- **Lifecycle Events**: Actor starts, stops, and restarts

## Deterministic Replay

The Event Chain enables deterministic replay of system execution:

- **Reproduce Behaviors**: Replay the same inputs to verify outputs
- **Debug Issues**: Step through execution to identify problems
- **Verify Fixes**: Confirm that changes resolve issues

Since WebAssembly execution is deterministic, replaying the same event chain will produce identical results.

## State Management

Theater's state management is designed to support traceability:

- **Explicit State Operations**: All state access is through the Store API
- **Versioned State**: Each state change creates a new version
- **Content-Addressed Storage**: States are identified by their content hash
- **Historical Access**: Previous states can be retrieved and examined

This approach ensures that state changes are traceable and verifiable.

## Debugging and Inspection

The Event Chain provides powerful debugging capabilities:

- **Event Inspection**: Examine specific events and their context
- **Timeline View**: See the sequence of events leading to an outcome
- **State Evolution**: Track how actor state changed over time
- **Causality Tracking**: Identify what triggered specific actions

## Benefits for Theater

Traceability and verification provide Theater with:

1. **Transparency**: System behavior is fully observable
2. **Accountability**: Actions can be attributed to their causes
3. **Debugging**: Problems can be diagnosed with complete information
4. **Verification**: System behavior can be validated
5. **Security**: Unauthorized changes can be detected

These properties make Theater particularly well-suited for critical applications where understanding and verifying system behavior is essential, especially when running AI-generated code that might require additional scrutiny.
