# Traceability & Verification

Traceability and verification form the third pillar of Theater, ensuring transparency, auditability, and reproducibility of system behavior. Theater achieves this by meticulously recording all significant events and state changes in a verifiable structure known as the Event Chain. This provides unprecedented insight into system execution, crucial for debugging, analysis, and building trust, especially when dealing with complex or AI-generated code.

## The Event Chain: A Verifiable System History

At the heart of Theater's traceability lies the **Event Chain**. Think of it as an immutable, comprehensive logbook that records everything significant that happens within the Theater system.

-   **Boundary Monitoring**: The system monitors the boundary of each actor (a [WebAssembly Component](./wasm-components.md)). Every piece of information crossing this boundary – inputs to function calls, outputs returned, messages sent or received – is captured as an event.
-   **Comprehensive Recording**: Events include actor creation/termination, message sends/receives, function calls into actors, return values, state changes, external inputs/outputs, and errors.
-   **Cryptographic Linking**: Each event recorded in the chain includes a cryptographic hash of the previous event. This creates a tamper-evident sequence; any modification to a past event would invalidate the hashes of all subsequent events, making unauthorized changes detectable.

This chain provides a complete, verifiable history of the system's execution flow and state evolution.

## Deterministic Replay for Debugging and Verification

Because [WebAssembly execution is deterministic](./wasm-components.md) and all inputs are captured in the Event Chain, Theater can precisely replay past executions:

-   **Reproduce Errors**: If an actor encounters an error, the exact sequence of events leading up to it can be replayed in a controlled environment (even on a different machine) to reliably reproduce the bug.
-   **Debug Complex Interactions**: Developers can step through the replayed sequence, examining actor states and messages at each point to understand complex emergent behaviors or pinpoint the root cause of issues.
-   **Verify Fixes**: After modifying actor code to fix a bug, the original problematic Event Chain can be replayed against the new code version to confirm the fix and check for regressions.
-   **Iterative Development**: This rapid feedback loop (run -> observe error -> capture chain -> replay/debug -> fix -> replay/verify) significantly accelerates development and improves code quality.

This capability is invaluable for understanding and debugging systems, especially those involving components whose internal logic might be complex or opaque (like AI-generated code).

## Verifiable State Management

Theater's approach to actor state management is tightly integrated with traceability:

-   **Explicit State Operations**: Actors interact with their persistent state via specific host functions provided by Theater (e.g., through a Store API).
-   **State Changes as Events**: Every modification to an actor's state is recorded as an event in the Event Chain, linked to the causal trigger (e.g., processing a specific message).
-   **Content-Addressed State (Potentially)**: State snapshots can be identified by a hash of their content, making it easy to reference and verify specific historical states recorded in the Event Chain. (Implementation details may evolve).

This ensures that not only the flow of execution but also the evolution of each actor's state is fully captured and verifiable.

## Inspection and Analysis Tools

The Event Chain serves as a rich data source for understanding system behavior. Theater aims to provide tools (or enable the building of tools) for:

-   **Event Inspection**: Browse and examining individual events and their associated data.
-   **Timeline Visualization**: Viewing the sequence of interactions between actors over time.
-   **State History**: Tracking how an actor's state evolved in response to events.
-   **Causality Analysis**: Tracing dependencies between events to understand cause-and-effect relationships.

## Benefits for Theater

The Traceability & Verification pillar provides:

1.  **Deep Transparency**: Making system behavior fully observable and understandable.
2.  **Powerful Debugging**: Enabling precise reproduction and diagnosis of errors.
3.  **Auditability & Verification**: Allowing independent verification of execution history and state changes.
4.  **Enhanced Trust**: Providing strong evidence of system behavior, critical for security and compliance.
5.  **Faster Iteration**: Accelerating bug fixing and validation cycles through deterministic replay.

By capturing a verifiable record of all actions, Theater provides the tools needed to understand, debug, and ultimately trust complex systems, even those incorporating components developed via novel or less transparent methods like AI code generation.
