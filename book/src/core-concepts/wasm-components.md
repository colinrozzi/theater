# WebAssembly Components & Sandboxing

WebAssembly (Wasm) Components form the foundational pillar for Theater's agent security, isolation, and deterministic behavior. By leveraging the Wasm Component Model, Theater creates sandboxed environments where AI agents can operate predictably and securely, with precise control over their capabilities and access to resources.

## The Power of WebAssembly for Secure Agent Execution

WebAssembly was designed with security as a primary goal. It provides several key features that make it ideal for running AI agents:

1. **Strong Sandboxing**: Each AI agent runs in a completely isolated memory space. Agents cannot access the host system's resources (like files, network, or environment variables) or the memory of other agents unless explicitly granted permission via specific imported functions.

2. **Limited Instruction Set**: Wasm's instruction set is intentionally minimal and well-defined. This eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities common in native code execution, making it safer to run autonomous agents.

3. **Capability-Based Security**: The Wasm Component Model relies on explicit interfaces defined using the WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) language. Agents declare the capabilities they need (like accessing specific APIs or communicating with other agents), and Theater acts as the gatekeeper, controlling which capabilities are provided to each agent.

This sandboxed, capability-based approach means that even sophisticated AI agents with complex behaviors can operate with strong security guarantees. Theater confines each agent's operations to only the resources and capabilities explicitly granted to them.

## Deterministic Execution for Predictable Agent Behavior

A crucial property Theater gains from WebAssembly is deterministic execution. Given the same inputs, an agent implemented as a Wasm component will always produce the same outputs and side effects *within the sandbox*.

- **Well-Defined Semantics**: Wasm has rigorously defined behavior, avoiding the ambiguities and undefined behaviors found in many other execution environments.
- **Controlled Environment**: All interactions with the outside world (beyond pure computation) must go through imported host functions, which Theater controls and monitors.

This determinism is essential for Theater's [Traceability & Verification](./traceability.md) pillar, enabling reliable replay, debugging, and verification of agent behavior.

## Language Agnosticism for Flexible Agent Implementation

WebAssembly serves as a portable compilation target for numerous programming languages (Rust, C/C++, Go, AssemblyScript, C#, and more). The Wasm Component Model further enhances this by allowing components written in different languages to interoperate seamlessly.

- **Implement Agents in Your Preferred Language**: Developers can choose the best language for their specific agent implementation.
- **Compose Diverse Capabilities**: An agent within Theater might itself be composed of multiple Wasm components, potentially written in different languages, providing specialized functionality.
- **Consistent Runtime Behavior**: Regardless of the implementation language, the compiled agent behaves predictably within the Theater runtime.

While the Component Model is still evolving across the ecosystem (with Rust having the most mature tooling currently), it provides a powerful, standardized way to build modular and interoperable agent systems.

## Interface Definitions with WIT

Theater uses the WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) language to define the contracts between agents and the system:

- **Agent Interfaces**: Specifies the functions an agent exposes to be called by Theater or other agents.
- **Host Capabilities**: Defines the capabilities the Theater runtime provides *to* agents (e.g., sending messages, accessing external APIs, storing data).
- **Message Formats**: Describes the structure and types of data exchanged between agents and the host.

These explicit interface definitions ensure clarity about what each agent can do and enforce the capability-based security model.

## Benefits for AI Agent Systems

By building upon WebAssembly Components, Theater achieves:

1. **Strong Isolation**: Preventing agents from interfering with each other or the host system.
2. **Precise Capability Control**: Granting agents only the specific access rights they need.
3. **Execution Determinism**: Enabling reliable replay, verification, and debugging of agent behavior.
4. **Implementation Flexibility**: Allowing agents to be developed in various languages.
5. **Modularity and Composability**: Facilitating the creation of complex agent systems from specialized components.
6. **Portability**: Ensuring agents can run consistently across different environments supporting Wasm.

This foundation allows Theater to provide a robust runtime environment for AI agent systems where security, reliability, and transparency are paramount concerns.
