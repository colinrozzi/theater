# Running AI-Generated Code Safely

AI code generation has become increasingly powerful and prevalent. Models like GPT-4, Claude, and specialized coding assistants can now write complex functions, entire modules, and even complete applications with minimal human guidance. This capability offers tremendous productivity benefits, but also introduces new challenges in terms of code quality, reliability, and security.

Theater was designed with these challenges in mind, providing a robust framework for running AI-generated code safely and effectively.

## The AI Code Generation Landscape

Before diving into how Theater helps, let's understand the current landscape of AI code generation:

### Strengths of AI-Generated Code

- **Speed and Volume**: AI can generate large amounts of code quickly
- **Breadth of Knowledge**: Modern LLMs have been trained on vast repositories of code across languages and frameworks
- **Pattern Replication**: AI excels at implementing standard patterns and boilerplate code
- **Adaptation**: AI can often adapt code to new contexts or requirements with minimal guidance

### Challenges with AI-Generated Code

- **Correctness Validation**: Verifying that large volumes of AI-generated code work correctly
- **Subtle Bugs**: AI can introduce subtle logical errors that pass syntax checks but cause runtime issues
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: AI might inadvertently replicate insecure patterns from its training data
- **Debugging Complexity**: Understanding and fixing issues in code you didn't write
- **Integration Problems**: Ensuring AI-generated components work properly with the rest of your system

## How Theater Addresses These Challenges

Theater provides a comprehensive solution for running AI-generated code safely:

### 1. Containment through WebAssembly Sandboxing

AI-generated code in Theater runs within WebAssembly sandboxes, which:

- Prevent direct access to the host system or other components
- Limit resource consumption through configurable limits
- Create clear boundaries around what the code can and cannot do
- Enable the safe execution of code that hasn't been thoroughly reviewed

```rust
// Example of compiling AI-generated code to WebAssembly
fn compile_ai_code(source: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, CompileError> {
    // Compile the AI-generated code to WebAssembly
    let wasm_binary = your_compiler.compile(source)?;
    
    // Return the WebAssembly binary
    Ok(wasm_binary)
}

// Load the WebAssembly component into Theater
let actor_id = theater.load_component(&wasm_binary, &manifest)?;
```

### 2. Fault Isolation through Actor Supervision

Theater's supervision system ensures that failures in AI-generated code don't cascade through your entire application:

- Parent actors can monitor child actors (which might be AI-generated)
- If a child actor fails, the parent can restart it or take other recovery actions
- Failures are contained to the specific actor that encountered the issue
- The system as a whole remains stable even if individual components fail

```rust
// Example of a supervision strategy for AI-generated actors
use theater::supervisor::*;

fn handle_child_failure(child_id: &ActorId, error: &Error) -> SupervisorAction {
    match error {
        // For temporary errors, restart the actor
        Error::Temporary(_) => SupervisorAction::Restart,
        
        // For more serious errors, stop the actor and notify the admin
        Error::Critical(_) => {
            notify_admin(child_id, error);
            SupervisorAction::Stop
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Traceability for Debugging and Improvement

One of the biggest challenges with AI-generated code is understanding what went wrong when issues occur. Theater's traceability features address this directly:

- Every state change is recorded in a verifiable chain
- All inputs and outputs are captured for later analysis
- Developers can trace the exact sequence of events that led to a failure
- This information can be used to improve the AI code generation process

```rust
// Example of reviewing state history for an AI-generated actor
let history = theater.get_state_history(actor_id)?;

// Analyze the history to find the cause of the issue
for state in history {
    println!("State at {}: {:?}", state.timestamp, state.data);
    
    // Look for the state change that caused the problem
    if let Some(problem) = identify_problem(&state) {
        println!("Found potential issue: {}", problem);
        
        // Use this information to improve the prompt for the AI
        let improved_prompt = generate_improved_prompt(problem);
        println!("Suggested prompt improvement: {}", improved_prompt);
    }
}
```

## Practical Patterns for AI-Generated Actors

When working with AI-generated code in Theater, consider these patterns:

### 1. Incremental Responsibility

Start by giving AI-generated actors small, well-defined responsibilities, then gradually increase their scope as you gain confidence:

1. Begin with simple data transformation actors
2. Progress to actors that maintain internal state
3. Eventually allow AI-generated actors to spawn and supervise other actors

### 2. Clear Interface Boundaries

Define clear interfaces for your AI-generated actors:

```toml
# Example manifest for an AI-generated actor
name = "ai-generated-processor"
component_path = "ai_processor.wasm"

[interface]
implements = "ntwk:data-processing/processor"
requires = []

[[handlers]]
type = "message-server"
config = {}
```

By strictly defining the interfaces, you constrain what the AI-generated code needs to do and limit the potential impact of issues.

### 3. Supervision Hierarchies

Design your supervision hierarchies to properly manage AI-generated components:

- Human-written supervisor actors at the top levels
- AI-generated actors in the middle or leaf positions
- Critical systems supervised by human-written code
- Non-critical systems can be supervised by other AI-generated actors

### 4. Continuous Verification

Use Theater's traceability features to continuously verify the behavior of AI-generated actors:

- Set up automated tests that verify state transitions
- Monitor for unexpected patterns in actor behavior
- Use the collected data to improve future iterations of the AI-generated code

## Case Study: AI-Generated Microservices

A compelling use case for Theater is running a network of AI-generated microservices. In this scenario:

1. Each microservice is implemented as a Theater actor
2. The services communicate through well-defined message interfaces
3. A supervision hierarchy ensures system stability
4. Complete traceability provides visibility into the entire system

This approach allows organizations to rapidly develop and deploy new services, leveraging AI for code generation while maintaining system reliability and security.

## Future Directions

The integration of AI code generation with Theater is still evolving. Some exciting future directions include:

- **Feedback Loops**: Automatically using state history and failure data to improve AI prompts
- **Self-Healing Systems**: AI-powered supervisors that learn from past failures to improve recovery strategies
- **Hybrid Development**: Tools that seamlessly blend human and AI-written components within the Theater framework

By providing a structured, safe environment for running AI-generated code, Theater enables developers to confidently embrace the productivity benefits of AI while mitigating the associated risks.
