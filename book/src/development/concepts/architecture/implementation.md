# Implementation Details

This page provides technical specifics about Theater's implementation, covering internal data structures, algorithms, and design decisions.

## Actor Executor

### WebAssembly Engine

Theater uses Wasmtime as its WebAssembly engine:

- **Component Model Support**: Uses Wasmtime's component model implementation
- **Resource Management**: Handles memory and table limits
- **Capability Exposure**: Controls which capabilities are available to components
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Supports async operations through poll-based approach

### Host Function Implementation

Host functions are implemented using:

- **WIT Bindings**: Generated from WIT interface definitions
- **Capability Checking**: Runtime validation of permission to use functions
- **Event Recording**: Automatic recording of function invocations
- **Resource Limiting**: Constraints on resource usage

## Event Chain

### Data Structure

The Event Chain uses a linked data structure:

- **Block Structure**: Events are grouped into blocks
- **Cryptographic Linking**: Each block links to previous block via hash
- **Content Addressing**: Events and blocks are referenced by content hash
- **Efficiency**: Uses optimized serialization for compact representation

### Persistence

Event Chain persistence strategy:

- **Incremental Storage**: New events are appended efficiently
- **Background Compaction**: Periodic optimization of storage
- **Index Structures**: Efficient lookup by actor, time, or event type
- **Pruning Options**: Configurable retention policies

## Store System

### Content-Addressing

Store's content-addressed architecture:

- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 for content identification
- **Deduplication**: Identical content stored only once
- **Chunking Strategy**: Large content split into manageable chunks
- **Reference Counting**: Tracks usage for garbage collection

### Caching

Store's multi-level caching strategy:

- **Memory Cache**: Hot data kept in memory
- **Local Disk Cache**: Frequently accessed data on local storage
- **Distributed Cache**: Optional shared cache for clusters
- **Prefetching**: Predictive loading based on access patterns

## Message Processing

### Queue Implementation

Message queue architecture:

- **Priority Handling**: Messages can have different priorities
- **Backpressure**: Flow control for overloaded actors
- **Delivery Guarantees**: At-least-once delivery semantics
- **Batching**: Efficient processing of multiple messages

### Concurrency Model

Approach to concurrent execution:

- **Actor Isolation**: Actors execute independently
- **Thread Pool**: Configurable worker threads for execution
- **Work Stealing**: Efficient distribution of processing load
- **Fairness Policies**: Prevent starvation of actors

## Supervision System

### Fault Detection

How failures are detected:

- **Exception Tracking**: Catches WebAssembly exceptions
- **Resource Monitoring**: Detects excessive resource usage
- **Deadlock Detection**: Identifies non-responsive actors
- **Health Checks**: Periodic verification of actor health

### Recovery Implementation

How recovery is implemented:

- **State Preservation**: Maintains actor identity during restarts
- **Mailbox Handling**: Options for preserving or discarding pending messages
- **Escalation Chain**: Multi-level supervision hierarchy
- **Circuit Breaking**: Prevents repeated rapid failures

## Networking

### Protocol Design

Communication protocol details:

- **Message Format**: Binary protocol with versioning
- **Compression**: Adaptive compression based on content
- **Authentication**: TLS with certificate validation
- **Multiplexing**: Multiple logical connections over single transport

### WebSocket Implementation

WebSocket support details:

- **Subprotocol**: Theater-specific subprotocol
- **Event Streaming**: Efficient real-time events
- **Backpressure**: Client-side flow control
- **Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection with session resumption

Understanding these implementation details provides insight into the technical decisions that enable Theater's unique properties and how they are realized in practice.
