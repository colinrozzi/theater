# Theater Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Theater, a WebAssembly actor system designed for safe execution of untrusted code with comprehensive traceability.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is organized into sections that follow a natural learning progression:

- **Introduction**: Understand why Theater exists and the problems it solves
- **Core Concepts**: Learn what Theater is and its fundamental principles
- **Architecture**: Discover how Theater works internally
- **User Guide**: Find practical information on using Theater in your projects
- **Development**: Learn how to build actors and extend Theater's functionality
- **Services**: Explore the built-in services and handler systems
- **API Reference**: Access detailed API documentation

## The Three Pillars of Theater

Theater is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **[WebAssembly Components & Sandboxing](core-concepts/wasm-components.md)**: Security boundaries and deterministic execution
2. **[Actor Model & Supervision](core-concepts/actor-model.md)**: Isolation, message-passing, and fault tolerance
3. **[Traceability & Verification](core-concepts/traceability.md)**: Comprehensive event tracking and deterministic replay

Understanding these pillars provides the foundation for effectively using Theater.
